External ros packages that are not provided as binary installs.


# Add new external package

Please use `rosdep resolve <package>` to check, whether the package already
exists as pre-compiled binary.  If so, just mention the package in your
`package.xml`, so that it is installed by rosdep.  If not, add the repository
of this package to this folder by using `git submodule add`; for example

    git submodule add https://github.com/Sahloul/ar_sys.git ar_sys

If the package is not provided as git repository (check, whether there is a git
mirror), add an empty folder for that package `<package>` and a script
`get_<package>.sh` in this folder and add the `<package>` folder to the
`.gitignore` file.  The `get_<package>.sh` should download and extract the
package's contents into the folder `<package>`.

Should the package update upstream, `cd` to the folder of that package, do a
`git checkout` to the new version, then go back to this repo and do a
`git commit -am "..."`.

# usb_cam

This package does exist as a binary package, however during testing it turned
out, that it does currently not contain the latest fixes from the repo. As we
had problems with segmentation faults on the target hardware, we do need the
latest version. (> v0.3.6)
